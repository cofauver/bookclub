# Matchbook
**[Production site](http://matchbook.herokuapp.com)**

This is a bookclub app generated using the Yeoman [generator-angular-fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack). I'm using this project as a way to learn more about the MEAN stack. There's a ton to learn from the code that the generator produces.

To see some of what I've written about the experience, check out the [wiki for this page](https://github.com/cofauver/bookclub/wiki).
